 * any docbook tags in here. You can use html to achieve styles like bold,
 * italics, underline etc, and DocGen will process them according to which

 * You can still put in verbatim docbook, but there's no guarantee they will
 * show up in the view editor. If all you need is docbook output or have your
 * document on DocWeb, then that's ok.
